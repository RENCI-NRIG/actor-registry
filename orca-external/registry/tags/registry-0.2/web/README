NOTE: Now this is obsolete. We use the jsp interface now.

These are the php scripts that pull out information from a mysql database and display it on a browser.

These have to be deployed in the apache deployment directory. For geni.renci.org place these in /var/www  . On a mac laptop, store these in /Library/WebServer/Documents

Visit http://geni.renci.org/actors.php or http://localhost/actors.php for a view of all the actors.

These scripts assume the existence of a mysql db user called "registry" with password "registry" and a database called "ActorRegistry" with a table called "Actors". The schema for this db is stored in $ORCA_HOME/core/schema/registry.schema.sql  

This is the same database the Registry Server updates.
